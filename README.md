An game essay on gender discovery

Welcome to this place,

## The story

There's a long time that I had this idea. How to explore gender through a game ?

There is a large amount of resources on gender: studies, books, websites, etc.
But i was missing something, that could link self discovery and entertainment.

After thinking and thinking on how to do this, I finally arrived at the point I had to try out something.

So here we are, I'll bring here ideas, resources, code pieces and incrementally try to build something that I hope will become interesting for others.

## Disclaimer 

This is the very early stage, so please be patient.
I know, gender topics are controversial.
However, I'll try to make this work respectful and open.
You can also tell me if something is wrong : there always will be place for improvement.
Enjoy if you stay, sorry if to go, but it's okay.

## Concepts

Gender is an important part of who we are, but is is something of us on which we only have a partial understanding.
It is some kind of hidden state we have to discover during our life.

Gender may range from simple and non questioning to a more elaborate composition. 

A persona is a typical person, or character we will use for the game.
This persona will have it's own gender, supposed unknown at the start. 

The idea is to discover the gender of the persona. 

The problem is : how do it in a relatively simple way to make it accessible and entertaining ? 

I have to think about it ...
