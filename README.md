An game essay on gender discovery

Welcome to this place,

## The story

There's a long time that I had this idea. How to explore gender through a game ?

There is a large amount of resources on gender: studies, books, websites, etc.
But i was missing something, that could link self discovery and entertainment.

After thinking and thinking on how to do this, I finally arrived at the point I had to try out something.

So here we are, I'll bring here ideas, resources, code pieces and incrementally try to build something that I hope will become interesting for others.

## Disclaimer 

This is the very early stage, so please be patient.
This my personal universe i'd like to share, independently of any organization. 
I know, gender topics are controversial. 
For fun, entertainment and de-dramatization purpose the choice of humor and second degree has been done.
For simplicity, I do use stereotypes and I also have to reduce the amount of possibles in the spectrum.
However, I'll try to make this work respectful and open.
You can also tell me if something is wrong : there always will be place for improvement.
Enjoy if you stay, sorry if to go, but it's okay.
