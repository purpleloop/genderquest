An game essay on gender discovery

Welcome to this place,

## The story

There's a long time that I had this idea. How to explore gender through a game ?

There is a large amount of resources on gender, studies, books, websites, etc.
But i was missing something, that could link self discovery and entertainment.

After thinking and thinking on how to do this, I finally arrived at the point I had to try out something.

So here we are, I'll bring here ideas, resources, code pieces and incrementally try to build something that I hope will become interesting for others.

## Disclaimer 

This is the very early stage, so please be patient.
This my personal universe i'd like to share, independently of any organization. 
I know gender topics are often controversial. Feel free to stay, feel free to go, feel free to come back, it's okay.
I'll try to make this work the more respectful and open possible but, there always will be place for improvement.
